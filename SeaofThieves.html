        <h1>Sea of Thieves</h1>
        <p>
            Sea of Thieves is a 2018 action-adventure game developed by Rare and published by Microsoft Studios. The player assumes the role of a pirate who completes voyages from different trading companies. The multiplayer game sees players explore an open world via a pirate ship from a first-person perspective. Groups of players encounter each other regularly during their adventures, sometimes forming alliances, and sometimes going head-to-head.<br><br>
            Sea of Thieves was conceived in 2014. Rare was inspired by players of PC games such as Eve Online (2003), DayZ (2018), and Rust (2018) who used the game tools to create their own stories. Rare explored different settings, such as vampires and dinosaurs, before settling on a pirate theme inspired by the Pirates of the Caribbean films and The Goonies (1985). The game features a progression system that only unlocks cosmetic items as the development team wanted to encourage both casual and experienced players to play together. Rare departed from its reputation for secrecy during Sea of Thieves's development, inviting fans to test the game's early builds.<br><br>
            Microsoft Studios released Sea of Thieves in March 2018 for Windows and Xbox One; it was one of the earliest first-party games released for Xbox Game Pass subscribers. Sea of Thieves received mixed reviews; critics praised the ship combat, multiplayer, visuals, and physics, but criticized the progression, gameplay, and lack of content. Rare envisioned Sea of Thieves as a "game as a service" and released numerous content updates after the initial release, which improved its overall reception. Some of the latest updates include Season 8 releasing a new on-demand player versus player naval battle featuring the noble Guardians of Fortune and the opposing faction of the Servants of the Flame. Sea of Thieves was a commercial success and became Microsoft's most successful original intellectual property of the eighth generation, attracting more than 30 million players by June 2022. An enhanced version of the game was released for the Xbox Series X/S in November 2020.<br><br>

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            Sea of Thieves is a first-person perspective action-adventure. At the beginning of the game, the player selects their procedurally generated player avatar.[1] The game is set in a shared world, which means groups of players will encounter each other throughout their adventures. Solo and duo players sail around in a nimble sloop while players playing in a group control a larger three-person brigantine or a four-person galleon cooperatively by assuming different roles; such as steering the ship, manning the cannons, navigating, boarding enemy ships, and scouting from the crow's nest Players can save the loadout of the ship, customize the ship's hull, figurehead, sails and captain's quarters, as well as name their ship occasionally players may encounter hostile players who may attack them with cannonballs or board their ship if areas under the deck take damage, water will flow in and cause the ship to gradually sink. Players need to patch up the holes with planks of wood and bail out water using buckets.  Alliances can be established with other parties of players. They will receive gold bonuses when a group in the same alliance sells any form of treasure. Forming an alliance does not prevent players from attacking each other.  f the player dies, they are sent to a ghost ship known as the Ferry of the Damned where they wait until they can respawn a competitive multiplayer mode named "Arena" was introduced in the Anniversary update; it allows up to six teams of players to compete against each other by gathering silver in smaller maps. Due to low player participation, this game mode was subsequently removed in a later update.<br><br>
            can complete voyages offered by the game's three main trading companies: Gold Hoarders, Order of Souls, and the Merchant Alliance. In the quests offered by Gold Hoarders, players are given a treasure map or a riddle to locate a treasure chest. The voyages offered by the Order of Souls are combat challenges, in which players travel to islands specified by the quest to defeat waves of skeletons. The Merchant Alliance's missions demand players to deliver animals or cargo to certain vendors within a limited time three smaller factions also exist. Two of them, the Hunter's Call and the Reaper's Bones, do not offer quests. The Hunter's Call will reward players who bring them cooked fish and meat, particularly from rarer types of fish. The Reaper's Bones will pay for all kinds of treasures, and players can also give them special cursed treasures or emissary flags stolen from other ships. When players collect a treasure, they need to deliver them to the representatives of the quest-giving faction, though the one holding the chest are defenseless and may have it be taken by other players.  Selling the treasure earns players gold,  which can be spent on buying cosmetic items.  Pets, emotes and further cosmetic items can also be purchased using real-world currency by accessing the Pirate Emporium store.  Doubloons, earned through completing commendations from the Bilge Rats, the fourth trading company that distributes quests, challenges, and cosmetics added to the game via post-launch updates, can be traded for cosmetics, gold, or reputation to the other factions. The Anniversary update added Tall Tales, which are a series of structured narrative missions Selling treasures to any of the three main trading companies, as well as Reaper's Bones or Athena's Fortune, earns the player reputation points, which unlock more complicated quests from each faction and additional purchasable cosmeticsWhen players reach rank 50 with any three of the 6 trading companies, they will earn the title of "pirate legend", which grants players new cosmetic items and access to a pirate hideout, the Tavern of Legends, as well as a special trading company called Athena's Fortune.<br><br>
            Players can freely explore the game's open world on their own or with other players. When exploring islands players can find various resources: food like bananas, coconuts, and mangos, which restore their health, as well as wood planks, firebombs, blunderbombs, and cannonballs. Rowboats can be used to carry cargo while avoiding potential hazards. There are four weapons players can choose from, which are cutlasses, pistols, blunderbusses, and sniper rifles that can be used to defeat hostile enemies.
